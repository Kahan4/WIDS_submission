# WIDS_submission
A repo created to submit the solved WIDS assignments by me.


These are the first three assignments given to us. The aim of the first assignment was to familiarize us with numpy library of python. The second assignment was aimed to give us the introduction to RL, and explain the concept of multi-armed bandits to us. I learned different methods to explore/exploit the case of multi-armed bandits, and the assignment was about the implementation of various ways to solve the multi-armed bandit problem. The third week was aimed to teach us about Markov Decision process (MDP).
